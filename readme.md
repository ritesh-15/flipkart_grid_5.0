# Loyalty and Rewards Program for Flipkart Grid 5.0

Welcome to the Loyalty and Rewards Program repository! This project aims to revolutionize customer engagement in E-commerce platforms by leveraging the power of blockchain technology. Our goal is to enhance security, transparency, and user experience through a seamless loyalty program.

## Problem Statement

E-commerce platforms often struggle with user retention and engagement. Traditional loyalty programs can lack transparency, leading to customer skepticism. Inefficient settlement processes between brands and platforms can further hinder user satisfaction. Our solution addresses these challenges by introducing a blockchain-enabled loyalty and rewards program.

## Features

- Transparent tokenomics and governance rules.
- User-friendly interface to track tokens, rewards, and progress.
- Automatic decay of unused tokens.
- Secure and instant settlements on-chain.
- Brand and seller reward issuance to loyal customers.
- Referral rewards for both referrers and referred users.
- Interaction with a smart contract built in Solidity.
- Utilizes Next.js for frontend and Strapi for backend.
- Runs on the Polygon blockchain.
